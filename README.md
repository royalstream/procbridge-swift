# procbridge-swift

ProcBridge is a super-lightweight IPC (Inter-Process Communication) protocol over TCP socket or Unix domain socket. It enables you to **send and recieve JSON** between processes easily. ProcBridge is much like a simplified version of HTTP protocol, but only transfer JSON values.

Please note that this repo is the **Swift implementation** of ProcBridge protocol. You can find detailed introduction of ProcBridge protocol in the main repository: [gongzhang/procbridge](https://github.com/gongzhang/procbridge).
